		"Hi <N>! \nWe have two rules here: \n\n1) Don't be a dick. Respect the hotpockets (admins) if they nudge you - They'll be nice, I promise. \n2) Try to keep it vaguely on-topic. At least start discussions that are on-topic, and if they wander off somewhere interesting then it's not a big deal. \n\nIf you have any suggestions or wanna hurl abuse at our hotpockets, your targets are <A>. \n\nWe suggest that you join some of our other channels:\nGather in <#C1SAV0NNR|gamejams> if you wanna slam and do the space jam.\n<#C0KNZQ7K6|bitching> is great if you want to blow off some steam.\nTry out <#C25F64CRF|the_big_topic> for week-long discussions on different concepts in game design and development"
