At least start discussions that are on-topic, and if they wander off somewhere interesting then it's not a big deal. \n\nIf you have any suggestions or wanna hurl abuse at our hotpockets, your targets are <ADMINS>. \n\nWe suggest that you join some of our other channels:\n<#C25F64CRF|the_big_topic> contains interesting conversation related to game development and industry\n<#C0KNZQ7K6|bitching> is great if you want to blow off some steam."
