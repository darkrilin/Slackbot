# Gamemakerdevs Slackbot

This bot was created to assist with the moderation and community of the 
official slack team for [r/gamemaker](http://reddit.com/r/gamemaker).

While the features are fairly limited, it's useful for inviting people 
to the server and sending them the rules. The whole shabang runs on a 
free heroku instance at the moment, and is fairly buggy, but it gets 
the job done.

I'll figure out something more efficient in the future.
